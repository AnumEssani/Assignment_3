In this article, we will discuss the differences between Multi-tasking and Multi-threading. People generally get confused between these terms. On one hand,Multi-tasking is a logical extension to multi-programming, and on the other hand,Multi-threading is thread-based multi-tasking.

The basic difference between Multitasking and multi-threading is that Multi-tasking allows CPU to perform multiple tasks (program, process, task, threads) simultaneously whereas,Multi-threading allows multiple threads of the same process to execute simultaneously.
