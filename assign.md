# Difference Between Multitasking and Multi-threading in OS



# Multi-tasking   Multi-threading

In this article, we will discuss the differences between Multi-tasking and Multi-threading. People generally get confused between these terms. On one hand,Multi-tasking is a logical extension to multi-programming, and on the other hand,Multi-threading is thread-based multi-tasking.

The basic difference between Multitasking and multi-threading is that Multi-tasking allows CPU to perform multiple tasks (program, process, task, threads) simultaneously whereas,Multi-threading allows multiple threads of the same process to execute simultaneously.

# Multi-tasking:

Multi-tasking is when a CPU is provided to execute multiple tasks at a time. Multi-tasking involves often CPU switching between the tasks, so that users can collaborate with each program together. Unlike multi-threading, In multi-tasking, the processes share separate memory and resources. As multitasking involves CPU switching between the tasks rapidly, So the little time is needed in order to switch from the one user to next.

# Multi-threading:

Multi-threading is a system in which many threads are created from a process through which the computer power is increased. In multi-threading, CPU is provided in order to execute many threads from a process at a time, and in multi-threading, process creation is performed according to cost. Unlike multitasking, multi-threading provides the same memory and resources to the processes for execution.
